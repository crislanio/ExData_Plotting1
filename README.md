## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" from:

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* For description of the data, see Coursera Course Projects week 1 of Exploratory Data Analysis

## Scripts

The script ‘week1.R’ downloads the data and subsets it for only the relevant date
range, then saves it locally.

The four ‘plotXXX.R’ scripts create the four PNG files from the subset of the data.
